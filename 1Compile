-- creating a library to read files
LIBNAME libName BASE "path/data"; ** does not need a run statement at the end
/* BASE keyword is not needed, it is for reading SAS data. For other input sources ,we write EXCEL/SQL etc.
libname xlRead xlsx "path/folder1/folder2/filename.xlsx"
options validvarname= v7 --- enforces naming convention of SAS 7
proc contents data=xlRead.sheetName; -- reads the correct sheet
run; 
LIBNAME xlRead clear;  -- clear the library data  

-- Work library is temporary, files deleted at end of session; default setting
data= work.tablename;
data=tablename

-- Sample table
options validvarname = v7; -- to ensure data column names follow the norms
libname df1 xlsx "path/f1/f2/file.xlsx"; --- path to the file, df1 is the library name, xlsx is the type of data we want to import
proc contents data = df1.sheet_name; -- all sheets will be read as separate tables in the df1 library folder
run;  -- if run not added here, the next line to clear gets an error, that the library is being used
libname df1 clear; -- makes sense to clear data source not needed

-- importing data
proc import datafile="path/filename" dbms=filetype out=output-table name <replace>;
<guessingrows = n|max;>
run;
